# Build & Run Instructions 

- I went ahead and hosted the app on Heroku therefore, there is no need to run the app locally.
- Heroku is linked to my private Github Repo therefore, any push will run the build 
- The app url: https://umbrage-bradley.herokuapp.com
- The private github repo: https://github.com/murrayb2016/umbrage-bradley

# App Rational

For this app I chose to go with a NodeJS Express Handlebars stack. Given the small nature of this app Handlebars is a great lightweight solution to handle frontend/server side logic. I chose to run with javascript instead of typscript or a higher es^ since there was a limitted code base to maintain. The open source community within the nodeJS infastructure makes it simple to handle simple CRUD operations.
